### Stochastic Machine Replacement Problem

Solving a simple stochastic machine replacement problem using Markov Decision Process and linear programming. 

We compare results obtained with policy iteration, value iteration and linear programming and conduct a sensitivity analysis over 3 main parameters of the model.
